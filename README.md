# Introduction
Dive into valuable insights that uncover trends between skills and job opportunities in data analysis roles! 
This analysis highlights the average salary per skill in DA positions, identifies the most in-demand skills, and explores the "optimal" skill set for success in the field.

All queries and the Python visualization script are featured on the main page of the repository.

Additionally, you can explore the results of all 5 queries in CSV format here:

# Background
This project originated as a final assignment in the SQL course taught by the amazing Luke Baroussse. Check it out here.

All challenges were proposed in the course, with the main table (used in PostgreSQL) provided by the instructor. My task was to load the table locally and analyze the data using SQL queries, focusing on identifying trends relevant to my area of interest: "data analysis."

Additionally, I took the initiative to create data visualizations using Matplotlib in Python (something not included in the course) as an extra effort to enhance the presentation.

### The five main questions provided by the course were:
- What are the highest-paying jobs for my role?
- What skills are required for these top-paying roles?
- What are the most in-demand skills for my role?
- What are the top skills based on salary for my role?
- What are the most optimal skills to learn? (Optimal: High Demand AND High Paying)

# Tools I Used
For this analysis, I leveraged key skills essential to the data analysis process:

**PostgreSQL**: Used for storing and delivering data.

**SQL**: Applied in a traditional manner to perform queries and extract insights.

**Python**: The primary tool for handling query results (using Pandas) and creating visualizations (using Matplotlib).

**GitHub**: Used for version control and project publication.
